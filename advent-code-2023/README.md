# Advent Code 2023

This is the README for my 2023 Advent code Python practice.

There might be too many comments in the code but this is for me to be able to contextualise what the code is doing. 

Essentially, telling myself I'm not just writing code, I understand the code I write and can explain it to someone(Good skill for interviews)!
